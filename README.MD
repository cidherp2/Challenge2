# Challenge 2 advanced CSS portfolio

# Description
This is a portfolio that showcases my growing portfolio, it has a nav bar that takes you to the different and needed section. It has buttons that take you where you can contact me, and a picture of me.

# Application list
The list is displayed with images, it was said that the first image need to be bigger, bit it didn't fit the aesthetic i was going for, but i added it as an "on Hover" effect only on that one.
Whe you click some images you are taken to web pages i've made and if they don't they are web pages i'm planning to make.

# Media Query
The website is responsive and when it is resized it re arrenges for ease of read.
